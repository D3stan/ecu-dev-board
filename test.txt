Da testare

- RGB led drive (works)
- relay drive (works)

- simulazione pickup
	- da ESP (works)
	- da NPN (needs modifications)
- input pickup IC (works on bench)
- shorting pickup (works on bench)

- piezo sensor
	- opamp (works on bike)
	- basic


- spark detection from coil pin
- spark detection from wound wire
	- opamp
	- envelope


- killswitch closure to GND
- CDI spark

- batteryless

- TCI spark detection
- TCI spark interruption






Next:
- pick 2 male-female pinheader cables
- remove seat, ignition cover, tank
- test VR input from bike with avvitatore a impulsi spinning the flywheel
- test VR short circuit with SSR
- prepare cable (coil -> QS_COIL)
- test CDI spark detection


- pickup 12V battery, many cables
- connect battery, cable from coil to QS_COIL
- test SCR killswitch to kill spark
	- first with avvitatore
	- then start motorcycle


- same setup
- test CDI spark with avvitatore spinning flywheel
- test CDI with motorcycle
