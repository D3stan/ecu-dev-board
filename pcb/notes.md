# Future Design Improvement

## Schematic

* SMD electrolytics cap (e.i.: input bulk cap in the 12V to 5V buck converter)
* bigger connector (for ECU)
* adequate external sensors analog ground and supply
* more input voltage filtering





## General

* sensors wire's broke / cutting detection
* DRV8874 BDC motor fully integrated driver
